        “Selective mutism can make it difficult for individuals to express themselves verbally in certain social settings, but it doesn’t define their abilities or strength,” said [Spokesperson’s Name], an SMA representative and participant. “This triathlon symbolizes our commitment to breaking down barriers and ensuring that those with selective mutism receive the support and understanding they deserve.”
The SMA team, composed of supporters, families, and individuals affected by selective mutism, trained rigorously for months leading up to the event. Their efforts paid off as they crossed the finish line together, celebrating not just their personal achievements but also the collective impact of their advocacy.
The charity triathlon was also a major fundraising success, with SMA raising [amount] to support educational programs, therapy resources, and community outreach initiatives. Donations poured in from supporters worldwide, reinforcing the importance of their mission.
